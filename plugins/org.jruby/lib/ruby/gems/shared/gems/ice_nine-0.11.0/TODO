* Add a utility method that allows "NoFreeze" subclasses to be easily added for
  any constant.
  * Refactor the existing NoFreeze subclasses to use the method.

* Consider adding support for OpenStruct
  * should freeze the singleton class too in order to prevent no new members
  * being added (by new_ostruct_member)
