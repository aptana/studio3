# Dimension Description
dimension.description.2=* no longer measured, same as elapsed time, see PerformanceMonitor *
dimension.description.3=Change in the amount of memory allocated for Java objects.
dimension.description.4=Change in the amount of physical memory used by the process (other data resides in swap space).
dimension.description.7=Change in the amount of allocated memory (both, in physical memory and swap space, can be preallocated for future use).
dimension.description.8=Increase of the maximum working set size, useful with start-up tests.
dimension.description.9=Amount of wall-clock time.
dimension.description.10=User time
dimension.description.11=Amount of time the process ran on the CPU, while the CPU was in kernel mode.
dimension.description.19=Number of memory pages that were loaded from swap space on disk or from memory (i.e., in the latter case, they were not mapped in the process' page table, but already present in memory for some reason).
dimension.description.20=Amount of time the process ran on the CPU.
dimension.description.22=Commit Limit
dimension.description.23=Commit Peak
dimension.description.24=Physical Memory
dimension.description.25=Physical Available
dimension.description.26=System Cache
dimension.description.27=Kernel Total
dimension.description.28=Kernel Paged
dimension.description.29=Kernel Nonpaged
dimension.description.30=Page Size
dimension.description.31=Handle Count
dimension.description.32=Process Count
dimension.description.33=Thread Count
dimension.description.34=Change in the number of GDI (Graphics Device Interface) objects, can be useful for UI tests (particularly start-up tests).
dimension.description.35=USER Objects
dimension.description.36=Open Handles
dimension.description.37=Commit Total
dimension.description.38=Read Count
dimension.description.39=Write Count
dimension.description.40=Bytes Read
dimension.description.41=Bytes Written
dimension.description.42=Number of memory pages that were loaded from swap space on disk.
dimension.description.43=Number of memory pages that were loaded from memory (i.e., they were not mapped in the process' page table, but already present in memory for some reason).
dimension.description.44=Change in the process' code memory size, useful with start-up tests.
dimension.description.45=Change in the process' data and stack memory size.
dimension.description.46=Change in the process' library memory size.
dimension.description.48=Used Memory
dimension.description.49=Free Memory
dimension.description.50=Buffers Memory
dimension.description.51=Free Java Memory
dimension.description.52=Invocation Count
